<h4>Eiffel Tower:</h4>

is the tallest tower in Paris. Going up their let's you see the whole view of Paris. A beauty at night as it shines and glitters. Not only allowing you to get a beautiful view up at the top of the Eiffel Tower,
but also a great place to take pictures to put up in your frame. Almost 7 million people go to the Eiffel Tower every year.</p>
<h4>Palace of Versailles:</h4>
<p>It is a great place to go if you want to see the beauty of how people lived and how the atmosphere is. It is a beautiful palace lined up with rooms. It has many nice places to take pictures. 
the garden is lovely and you will light up at it's beauty. It is about a few miles away from Paris a neighboring city. Need a place to go to, Versailles is a half day trip and has wonderful things to do.</p>
<h4>Arc de Triomphe:</h4>
<p>A great place to snap a pic, it sure is. If you want to you can go all the way to the top and has a great view of Paris. The history in this fascinating place is that the king made it dedicated to the army of the war in 1836.</p>
<h4>Angelina's:</h4>
<p>Angelina's has the best hot chocolate ever. Need a place to just relax... it has amazing pastries, but it is known for the amazing hot chocolate. It is basically melted chocolate.</p>
<h4>Lauduree's:</h4>
<p>It has  the best macroons. So many flavors you will not imagine. From rasberry to some alcholic it has a great veriety of macroon that will delight you.</p>
<h4>Montmarte:</h4>

<h4>Saint-Chapelle:</h4>
<p>An amazing place with history. It is with stained glass, well the whole building is stained glass. It has many great views and a great place for pic.</p>
<h4>The Louvre:</h4>
<p>Amazing art that will fascinate you. A giant museum it is a day trip to enjoy it's wonders.In the middle a giant pyramid sparkiling the beauty.</p>
<h4>Luxembourg Garden:/h4>
<p>Need a place to just relax...this is a great place to. With a lake and a foot path, you can enjoy yourself by just walking around and admiring the wonders or instead just sit and relax. If you want you can have a picnic in the heart of the city.<br>
